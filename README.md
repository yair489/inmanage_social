## Description
A little about work
I set up a website that connects to SQL and realizes a social network with friends and posts
Each post can be viewed individually, edited, deleted or updated
The users can also be created, updated and deleted
In addition, there are several other functions that were performed according to the instructions in the PDF
* With the help of SQL, you can generate a query that will return all active users and their posts and display on the screen in a social media style, next to each user you must display the image retrieved in section 4. This section is fully implemented in the file `index_active.php`
* Given a date of birth for each user, return the last post of the user who has a birthday this month. This section was executed in the `brithday_post.php` file
* Create a table that counts how many posts were added every hour. Done in the `data_post.php` file
